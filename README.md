Complete Script to Use Peds In-Game

1 - Players Command /pedmenu to preview peds, submit a request to an admin, and manage the ones you have already been authorized to use.

2 - Admin Command /pedadmin to accept, reject, or remove a player's ped.

3 - If you wear a bird skin and press space, you can fly, and near the ground, pressing space again makes you land.

4 - Pressing R reloads the weapon and unlocks the ped.

The script is already preconfigured, but you can add more peds if you notice any missing in the config.lua.
